From the [Low Key Anki: Summary and Installation](http://massimmersionapproach.com/table-of-contents/anki/low-key-anki/low-key-anki-summary-and-installation/) page:

> *No_Penalties_or_Boosting.py* is a modified version of the original “Low Stakes Anki: No Penalties or Boosting” add-on created by ja-dark. In ja-dark’s original version, the “New Interval” setting in the deck options is overwritten, automatically making the new interval of lapsed cards 100% of the previous interval. This modified version will not override the “New Interval” setting in the deck options, so whatever is in the deck options will be used. Credit goes to [Lucas AKA YogaPants](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQFe3x4WAgm7joN5daMm5Ew) for the modification.

> *PassFail.py* is a copy of the “Low Key Anki: Pass/Fail” add-on created by ja-dark. It will replace the standard four answer buttons with simply “pass” and “fail”. When the add-on is installed, “2” (on the keyboard) will function as a hotkey for “pass”, and “1” will function as a hotkey for “fail”. If you are studying Japanese and would like to replace the words “pass” and “fail” with their Japanese translation, “当たり” and “外れ”, [here](https://www.mediafire.com/file/k3c32r7joxzcwl7/PassFail%28JP%29.zip) is a modified version of the add-on.
> 
> *ResetEZ.py* is an add-on which was created by YogaPants, and modified by omgUnicorns. ResetEZ resets the ease factor of all the cards in your collection to the default value of 250%. You can run the add-on by going to “Tools > Reset Ease + Force Sync After”. Make sure all your devices are already synced before running the add-on, as the add-on will automatically initiate a “force changes in one direction” sync. The reason for this is that Anki won’t upload the ease factor changes made by the add-on with a normal sync. There are two uses for this add-on. The first is to undo damage which was caused by overusing the “hard” button prior to adopting the Low Key Anki setup. In other words, to swiftly escape from “ease hell”.
